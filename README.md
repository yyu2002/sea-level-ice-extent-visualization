# sea-level-ice-extent-visualization

## Summary Description
In this short project, we read and clean two datasets, one of annual sea level data and one of annual sea ice extent (millions of square km), and plot these data first against years, then against eachother, to analyze the correlation between the two variables.  

## Datasets: 
Sea level - NOAA STAR (Center for Satellite Applications and Research): https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/extent/.

Sea ice extent - NCDC (National CLimatic Data Center): https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/extent/.
